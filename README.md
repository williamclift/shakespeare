# shakespeare

A program which uses Machine Learning and Regular Expressions to analyze a quote and determine whether or not it was written by The Bard, William Shakespeare.
The algorithm computes the Ngrams for each quote string, organizes subsets in a matrix, and performs a transformation which is comparable to a matrix representing the regression model for determining a quote's 'Shakespeare Resemblance'.
